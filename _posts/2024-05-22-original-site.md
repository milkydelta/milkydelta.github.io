# Greetings!

This is the first post ever made on the new version of the website.
If you were one of the only 3 people (myself included) to see the old site, you might notice some changes.

This new site is still on the same [GitHub Pages repo](https://github.com/milkydelta/milkydelta.github.io),
but it is now powered by [Jekyll](https://jekylrb.com) and [the Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter).

I put the old site's html page in a subdirectory of the repo.

[Here's a link, for the strange people.](https://www.077340.xyz/oldpages/1295863/)


For future reference, the filename of the md files can be used for the timestamp, but a date in front matter
overrules it.
